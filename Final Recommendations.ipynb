This is a determined looking Hal Jordan, embodying Willpower with his steely glare and clenched fist. The paint job is nice, and the points of articulation are not too intrusive. The only points where they are blatant is a slight cuff/socket effect at the shoulders, but overall not too bad at all.He comes with the ubiquitous lantern, and a Justice League of America base on which to mount him, which works well.

Although it says \"Assembly required: No\" on the specifications this is actually a model kit with >100 tiny pieces. If thats your thing great but I was hoping it would be a more or less out the box thing. coming from Japan I cant return it as I must pay postage so its not worth it. maybe one day i\\'ll get around to building it but probably not tbh. :/ ...  Y-Wings are cool so it still gets 2 stars... | Worth waiting for. // 3.0 // 13 Jan. 2016 // By\\n    \\n    souper\\n  \\n on 13 Jan. 2016 // I bought this model back in 15th December, had i known it was coming from Japan and that it would take so long i\\'d have looked for it locally, needless too say i\\'m mega-happy with it finally arriving last week and cannot wait until i get around to making it as i already have 3 others in the pipeline still to make. | Y-Wing Bandai - don\\'t miss out // 5.0 // 21 Mar. 2016 // By\\n    \\n    Noswad\\n  \\n on 21 Mar. 2016 // This kit is awesome. Perfect for any who loves modelling and Star Wars. Bandai is definitely the best brand and beats all counterparts. The models once assembled are highly detailed and replicate the real thing down to a tee!! The Y-Wing in particular is a favourite. | A superb model which can be terribly fiddly and frustrating // 5.0 // 14 Mar. 2016 // By\\n    \\n    CB\\n  \\n on 14 Mar. 2016 // A superb model which can be terribly fiddly and frustrating. Keep with it and take your time and you will reap the rewards of a superb model. Probably the best in the series. Worth adding wear and tear and exhaust streaking for the finished look.']\n",
