# Kaylees new toy: Using Amazon data to recommend a new toy for my daughter
Author: Deja Prade

# Overview

In this project, I build a toy recommendation system using the amazon e-commerce data. I develop a content-based recommendation model using NLP and a collaborative-based model using SVD. 

# Business Understanding

Kaylee (my stakeholder/daughter) is a one year old whom is pretty spoiled. Of course we do things the old-fashion way and pick out random toys in local stores but since starting the Flatiron Data Science program I haven't had much time for that. I wanted to develop a toy recommendation system to balance out school and mom life.

# Data
