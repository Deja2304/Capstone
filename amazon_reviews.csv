After studying the properties of charcoal in an academic setting regarding absorption of toxins in water filtration, I decided to pick this aluminum free deodorant. A few years earlier, I tried other aluminum free deodorants and they failed miserably. It smells good, with a mineraly fresh scent. I have sensitive skin, especially after shaving. After going to the dermatologist because I thought I had a serious rash with a burning sensation, we figured it was this deodorant. Now I know not to apply this deodorant the day or two after shaving. I reccomend this if you do not shave often. Also, it does stain gray and oily. Do not wear this on thin, light, or nice clothes. Good for wearing with neutral colored sweaters, for example. As for sweat prevention and odor reduction, it was satisfactory. I live in the northeast US, where we have cold winters and humid hot summers, so it was good for fall, winter and spring. Definitely did not do the job in summer. Also not as effective during exercise. Overall, this was a good alternative to aluminum antiperspirant when I am wearing thicker clothes I do not care about too much, in the colder months, when I am not exercising, and when I have not shaved for a day or two. To me, its better than constantly using aluminum antiperspirant.",NO,0,NA
